# Change Log

## 2.0.0 (2017-10-19)
* Fix [JS]: Reverted some scope colours. It's impossible now to fully match to the original theme, because scopes in VSC aren't enough customizable as in Sublime Text or Textmate. Use customization if you prefer other scope colours instead of provided by this theme.
* Other: Removed [better-less](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=radium-v.better-less) extension from dependencies. Now it's optional and recommended for Less users, because the theme still work more correctly together with better-less in the Less syntax.

## 1.0.1-1.1.0 (2017-10-18)
* Enhancement [JS]: Added several scope colours to match to the original Espresso Soda syntax theme
* Enhancement [Less]: Added the `meta.property-value.less` colour to match to the original Espresso Soda syntax theme
* Fix: Changed the `punctuation.definition.entity.css` colour to match to the original Espresso Soda syntax theme and added `punctuation.definition.entity.less` colour with last value from `punctuation.definition.entity.css`
* Other: Removed unused background declarations from the json file of the theme

## 1.0.0 (2017-10-11)
* Enhancement [Less]: Added the [better-less](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=radium-v.better-less) extension as dependence to improve Less syntax highlighting
* Enhancement [CSS/Less]: Added a few scope colours to match to the original Espresso Soda syntax theme
* Fix: Changed the invalid character colour (the `invalid.illegal` scope)

## 0.2.0 (2017-09-30)
